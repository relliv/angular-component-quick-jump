# angular-component-quick-jump (WIP)

Quick jump feature in angular component folders. Sometimes other extensions or too deep folder hierarchy makes it hard to find the component you are looking for. This extension will help you to quickly jump to the component you are looking for. It's saves scroll + click time.
